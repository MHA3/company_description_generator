Mercury, PCBs, and other contaminants can be passed on to a developing fetus through the placenta. Aquaculture and biochar are water toxicity regulators and detoxifiers. Biochar can adsorb and dissolve compounds from wastewater. Biofloc technology (BFT) is considered the new ‘green revolution’ because nutrients can be continuously recycled and reused in the growing medium, benefiting from minimal or no water changes. Biochar is the most effective and environmentally friendly method of eliminating toxicities in aquatic facilities while creating a conducive breeding ecology for fish reproduction. This method seeks to protect consumers by purifying the water and absorbing contaminants from water bodies and fishes which tends to affect consumers that feed on contaminated fishes.
